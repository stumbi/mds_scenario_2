Medical Data Science Scenario 2 Indoor Localisation

The Repo contains three directories:

- Code
  - helpers
  - temp
- Data
  - Data_Manuel
  - Data_Nils
- Notebooks
 

## Code

The Code directory has two pyhton files, one is called helpers, where several helper functions 
are stored. They are used at different occasions in the notebooks.

The temp file was only for testing and is irrelevant to the final results and therefore not commented.

## Data

In Data there are two directories with some subdirectories. There are different measurements by either 
Manuel or Nils, in the end we used the Measurement Data/Data_Nils/10_schritte and Data/Data_Nils/MDS_Scenario_2_nils_viereck.

The other readings aren't of interest for the final assignment.

## Notebooks

The Notebook Final_Application is what we are turning in. The other notebooks were used to create the 
single steps in the Final_Application notebook.

10_steps is also shown in the assignment paper, find_peaks_in_first_tests is very similar to 10_steps, 
but with different data. 

The visualize_data note is just plotting the measurements as they are.

The other notebooks were also used to prepare the final functions and plots.
